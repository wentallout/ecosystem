# test

- Jest: a horrible mess
- Mocha: not interested
- Storybook: rough, slow, bloated, heavy
- Cypress
- Puppeteer
- Playwright: GOOD, would use again
- WebdriverIO
- Vitest: GREAT, faster
- Mock Service Worker: GREAT, super powerful
- Bun testing stuff

## Pain points

- Testing thing TS already check
- Compatibility and runtime differences between test env and actual env
- Import mocking hell
- Jest stuff
- People still using Enzyme
